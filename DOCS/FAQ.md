***Who this script is writing for?***

This script is targeted at anyone who want to: i) obtain a single measure of grain size to estimate the magnitude of differential stress (or rate of mechanical work) in dynamically recrystallized rocks and ii) to derive the actual 3D population of grain sizes from the population of apparent 2D grain sizes measured in thin sections. The methods implemented assumes that grains have near-equant or not to far from near-equant shapes. This assumption is acceptable most of the time for some of the most common dynamically recrystallized non-tabular grains in crustal and mantle shear zones such as olivine, quartz, feldspar or calcite when bulging (BLG) or sub-grain rotation (SGR) are the main recrystallization processes. For studies involving objects geometrically more complex than near-equant objects, we recommend other approaches such as those implemented in the *CSDCorrections* (Higgins 2000).

***Does the script works in Python 2.7.x and 3.4.x?***

The code was written to run on both versions. So, the short answer is YES. However, the script has only been thoroughly tested on Python 2.7.x. If you run into any problem using the script with Python 3.4.x (or also 2.7.x) please let us know (see an email address here: http://marcoalopez.github.io/ ). Feedback from users is always welcome and important to us to develop a better script.
