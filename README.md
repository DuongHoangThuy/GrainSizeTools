[GrainSizeTools script](http://marcoalopez.github.io/GrainSizeTools/) is a free open-source cross-platform script written in [Python][1] that provides a number of tools with the aim of characterizing the grain size and the actual distribution of grain sizes from thin sections. The script is suitable to use in paleopiezometry studies, using different 1D grain size measures, as well as to derive the actual 3D grain size distribution using two different methods. The script only requires the previous measurement of the grain sectional areas from a thin section. There is **no need** of previous knowledge of Python programming language to use the script and get the results (see [documentation][2]). For advanced users, the script is organized in a modular way using Python functions, which facilitates to modify, reuse or extend the code if needed.

Features at a glance
-------------

- It allows loading and automatically extract data of interest from txt and csv files generated by the ImageJ or similar applications.
- It allows calculating the apparent diameters of the grain profiles from their sectional areas via the equivalent circular diameter. It also allows to correct the diameters calculated by adding the perimeter of the grains.
- It allows estimating different 1D grain sizes for paleopiezometry studies, including the mean, the median, the area-weighted mean and the frequency peak of the apparent grain sizes.
- It implements several algorithms to estimate the optimal bin size of histograms and the optimal bandwidth of the Gaussian KDE based on the population features.
- It allows estimating the actual 3D grain size distribution from thin sections (2D data) using the Saltykov method to unfold the apparent grain size distribution. Similar to what the *StripStar* script does.
- It estimates the volume of a particular grain fraction defined by the user.
- In the case of completely recrystallized samples, it also allows to estimate a complete quantitative description of the 3D grain size distribution using a new method named the two-step method (Lopez-Sanchez and Llana-Fúnez, submitted).
- It produces a number of different ready-to-publish plots, allowing to save the graphical output as a bitmap or vector images. The script include the following plots: i) the number- and area-weighted population of apparent grain sizes, ii) the frequency and volume-weighted cumulative frequency curve of the estimated 3D grain size distribution, and iii) the best-fit log-normal probability density function with errors.
